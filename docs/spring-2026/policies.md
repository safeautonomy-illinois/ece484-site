# Policies - Spring 2026

## Course Description

_Goals:_ By the end of this course, you will gain an understanding of the key concepts involved in designing and evaluating autonomous systems. These concepts can be organized around three core tasks: (a) sensing, perception, and state estimation; (b) decision making, planning, and control; and (c) evaluation and correctness arguments based on formal verification. Machine learning techniques play an important role across all three tasks. You will also gain hands-on experience implementing algorithms and models using state-of-the-art software tools. Finally, the course provides practical experience in engineering a complete autonomy stack for a sensor-rich platform—such as a full-sized vehicle, a quadrotor, or a scaled vehicle—with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation.

_Expectations:_ You are expected to (a) attend lectures **(TTh 11–12:30)** and keep up with the material through the suggested exercises; (b) complete **four homework and programming assignments**; (c) attend **Friday lab sections** to discuss and work through assignments; (d) prepare for and take **three in-class midterms**; and (e) complete a substantial **autonomy project**. Additional details are provided below.



## Assignments (a.k.a MPs)

There will be 4 Machine Problems (MPs) involving coding in Python and ROS and experimentation. You will work with your teammates to implement lane detectors, path planners, localization algorithms, and use latest tools for vehicle simulation and verification. Lab sessions will help you get started with the MPs. Each MP will have a submission deadline (usually Friday. 11:59 PM). See the [Assignment page](assignments.md) for more details.

_Tech requirements:_ For the assignments, you will be programming with ROS. More details are provided on the [Resources page](resources.md).


## Friday Labs 

Laboratory sections are held in ECEB 5072 on Fridays to help you learn about the assignment of the week, learn ROS2 and related autonomy software and simulators, and also demo your work to TAs.

| **Session** | **TA** | **CA** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AB1 (9am-10am) | Fatemeh |  |
| AB2 (10am-11am) | James |  |
| AB3 (11am-12pm) | Will |  |
| AB4 (12pm-1pm) | Alex |  |
| AB5 (1pm-2pm) | Hanna |  |
| AB6 (4pm-5pm) | Abhishek |  |


Each week after a new MP is released, your entire group **will have to attend** your respective lab section. These labs will introduce the MP, the related software, and also teach you the necessary tools. The lab attendance is taken as a group and counts towards your MP score.

Each week an MP is due,  your entire group **will have to attend** your registered lab section to demo the MP. Your MP will be graded in part based on this demo. This demo will include a short 2-3 question oral exam to check your understanding of the MP concepts and code.

Follow these rules  when using the lab machines:

- ROS2 and Gazebo must be killed after using and cannot be left running after logging out.

- Do not shut down the machine. Log out your account when you are not using the machine.

## Homeworks

There will be 4 homework assignments (HW). The homework exercises are going to help you learn the mathematical concepts and prepare for the midterm exams. You will solve the homework problems individually and they are released and due alongside the MPs.

## Exams

Three in-class, pencil-paper midterms will test you on core concepts. Sample exams may or may not be released, however, the exercises in the [course reader](/ece484-site/assets/pdfs/coursereader.pdf) and the homework will provide many practice problems.

## Project

The team  project is your opportunity to impress  and build your own autonomous vehicle! The project will be graded based on presentation, results, organization. Additional details are available [here](projects.md)

## Grading

- MPs (mostly team): 35%

- HWs (individual): 4 x 2.5 =  10%

- Mini Project (team): 25%

- Midterms (individual): 3 x 10 = 30%


## Course material 

The [course reader](/ece484-site/assets/pdfs/coursereader.pdf) and the lecture slides will serve as the primary source material. There is no required textbook. We will also use material from the following reference texts:

- [Probabilistic Robotics](http://www.probabilistic-robotics.org/) by Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, Dieter Fox.  MIT press, 2017. Slides are available from the book's page.
- [Verifying Cyberphysical Systems: A Path to Safe Autonomy](https://www.amazon.com/Verifying-Cyber-Physical-Systems-Autonomy-Physical/dp/0262044803) by Sayan Mitra,  MIT press, 2021. [Slides](https://sayanmitracode.github.io/cpsbooksite/slides.html).

## Individual and team work

For the team-based work, you will work in groups of 3 or 4  for the class project, labs, and the MPs. On the first week of class, you will have to create your team within your lab sections (AB1-AB5). Homework assignments and exams will be solo activities for each of you to engage deeply with the material. There will be labs and office hours to get help.


## Responsible AI Usage Policy

You may use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude code)  only if you clearly attribute their use.
You are responsible for understanding, verifying, and defending everything you submit. You will be asked to explain your code live. There is no replacement for learning the concepts with exercises. Therefore, we strongly recommend you to **not use** AI tools for the homework problems. No AI use permitted in the exams or during office hours. 

If a student is found to have submitted code they cannot adequately explain or understand, penalties will be applied. 

<!-- During office hours, extensive reliance on AI tools is discouraged. The purpose of office hours is to assess and improve your understanding. Overuse of AI during this time may result in a warning or affect your participation grade. The purpose of office hours is _not_ to identify LLM hallucinations by comparing answers with the TA on duty, nor to explain why the LLM may or may not have hallucinated on a given prompt. -->

<!-- This policy may be subject to change as we continue to evaluate the impact of AI tools on learning outcomes. Students will be notified of any changes to this policy via Campuswire announcement (and an updated policy here). We are trying to strike a balance between use of modern tools and comprehensive understanding of course fundamentals. Use AI responsibly and as a learning aid, not a substitute for your own critical thinking and problem-solving skills; future you will thank you. -->


<!-- # University and College Policies

- **_We in the Illinois ECE community are committed to understanding, empathizing with, and respecting each other, embracing the many differences among us._**
    - The Grainger College of Engineering is committed to the creation of an anti-racist, inclusive community that welcomes diversity along a number of dimensions, including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, disability status, class, age, or religious beliefs. The College recognizes that we are learning together in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement, that Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous voices and contributions have largely either been excluded from, or not recognized in, science and engineering, and that both overt racism and micro-aggressions threaten the well-being of our students and our university community.
    
    - The effectiveness of this course is dependent upon each of us to create a safe and encouraging learning environment that allows for the open exchange of ideas while also ensuring equitable opportunities and respect for all of us. Everyone is expected to help establish and maintain an environment where students, staff, and faculty can contribute without fear of personal ridicule, or intolerant or offensive language. If you witness or experience racism, discrimination, micro-aggressions, or other offensive behavior, you are encouraged to bring this to the attention of the course director if you feel comfortable. You can also report these behaviors to Campus Belonging Resources ([https://diversity.illinois.edu/diversity-campus-culture/belonging-resources/)](https://diversity.illinois.edu/diversity-campus-culture/belonging-resources/\)). Based on your report, Members of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion staff will follow up and reach out to students to make sure they have the support they need to be healthy and safe. If the reported behavior also violates university policy, staff in the Office for Student Conflict Resolution may respond as well and will take appropriate action.

- **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA):** Any student who has suppressed their directory information pursuant to Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) should self-identify to the instructor to ensure protection of the privacy of their attendance in this course. See [https://registrar.illinois.edu/academic-records/ferpa/](https://registrar.illinois.edu/academic-records/ferpa/) for more information on FERPA.

- **Mental Health:** Significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry, substance/alcohol misuse or interferences in eating or sleep can have an impact on academic performance, social development, and emotional wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings which are covered through the Student Health Fee. If you or someone you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly encouraged to contact or visit any of the University’s resources provided below:
    - Counseling Center (217) 333-3704
    
    - McKinley Health Center (217) 333-2700
    
    - National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (800) 273-8255
    
    - Rosecrance Crisis Line (217) 359-4141 (available 24/7, 365 days a year)
    
    - If you are in immediate danger, call 911.

- **Students with Disabilities:** To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and provide the instructor with a Letter of Academic Accommodations from Disability from [DRES](http://www.disability.illinois.edu/) located at 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, 217-333-1970, e-mail disability@illinois.edu.

- **Class Attendance and Absence Policy:**  [Part 5, 1-501 of the Student Code](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/) provides background on class attendance and provides useful information for students. The code stipulates the conditions under which an [absence letter from the Office of the Dean of Students](https://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/resources/students/absence-letters/#request) may be requested. A brief illness - less than 3 days - would not qualify for an absence letter.

- **Academic Integrity:** Academic dishonesty may result in a failing grade, _ignorance is not an excuse for any academic dishonesty_.  Every student is expected to review and abide by the Academic Integrity Policy described in [Part 4, 1-401 of the Student Code](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/) --- it is your responsibility to read this to avoid any misunderstanding. Do not hesitate to ask the instructor(s) if you are in doubt about what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, or any other breach of academic integrity.

In addition to departmental and college advising offices, many resources are available to help struggling students, such as the [Student Assistance Center](https://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/student-assistance-center/), [Counseling Center](http://counselingcenter.illinois.edu/) (View additional resources: [Counseling Center at Engineering Hall](https://emails.illinois.edu/files/356662808/counselingflyersp225463.pdf) and [Let’s Talk](https://emails.illinois.edu/files/356662808/letstalkembeddedflyerengineeringspring20225187.pdf)), and our college's embedded counselor, Dr. George.

Students who miss a considerable amount of coursework can reach out to their undergraduate [departmental](https://advising.grainger.illinois.edu/advising/meetingdept) and [college](https://advising.grainger.illinois.edu/advising/meeting) academic advisors or [departmental graduate program coordinator](https://grainger.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/department-contacts) to discuss options. Missing work in multiple classes due to illness or other circumstances can be difficult to recover from, and it may be in the student’s best interest to reduce the number of courses they are taking. Advisors can help students through this process.

### Sexual Misconduct Reporting Obligation

The University of Illinois is committed to combating sexual misconduct. Faculty and staff members are required to report any instances of sexual misconduct to the University’s Title IX Office. In turn, an individual with the Title IX Office will provide information about rights and options, including accommodations, support services, the campus disciplinary process, and law enforcement options.

A list of the designated University employees who, as counselors, confidential advisors, and medical professionals, do not have this reporting responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be found here: [wecare.illinois.edu/resources/students/#confidential](http://wecare.illinois.edu/resources/students/#confidential).

Other information about resources and reporting is available here: [wecare.illinois.edu](http://wecare.illinois.edu/).

### Religious Observances

Illinois law requires the University to reasonably accommodate its students’ religious beliefs, observances, and practices in regard to admissions, class attendance, and the scheduling of examinations and work requirements. You should examine this syllabus at the beginning of the semester for potential conflicts between course deadlines and any of your religious observances. If a conflict exists, you should notify your instructor of the conflict and follow the procedure at [https://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/resources/students/religious-observances/](https://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/resources/students/religious-observances/) to request appropriate accommodations. _This should be done in the first two weeks of classes._

### Disability-Related Accommodations

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603, e-mail [disability@illinois.edu](mailto:disability@illinois.edu) or go to [https://www.disability.illinois.edu](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/).  If you are concerned you have a disability-related condition that is impacting your academic progress, there are academic screening appointments available that can help diagnosis a previously undiagnosed disability. You may access these by visiting the DRES website and selecting “Request an Academic Screening” at the bottom of the page.

### Anti-Racism and Inclusivity Statement

The intent is to raise student and instructor awareness of the ongoing threat of bias and  
racism and of the need to take personal responsibility in creating an inclusive learning  
environment.

The Grainger College of Engineering is committed to the creation of an anti-racist, inclusive community that welcomes diversity along a number of dimensions, including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, disability status, class, age, or religious beliefs. The College recognizes that we are learning together in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement, that Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous voices and contributions have largely either been excluded from, or not recognized in, science and engineering, and that both overt racism and micro-aggressions threaten the well-being of our students and our university community.

The effectiveness of this course is dependent upon each of us to create a safe and  
encouraging learning environment that allows for the open exchange of ideas while also  
ensuring equitable opportunities and respect for all of us.
