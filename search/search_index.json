Thus, students are expected to fully understand any code they submit, regardless of its source. This includes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The ability to explain the code at a line-by-line level</p> </li> <li> <p>Understanding of all function calls and their purposes</p> </li> <li> <p>Comprehension of the overall logic and structure of the code</p> </li> </ul> <p>If a student is found to have submitted code they cannot adequately explain or understand, penalties may be applied. These may include a reduction in the assignment grade, a requirement to redo the assignment without AI assistance, or, in severe cases, a referral to the academic integrity office.</p> <p>During office hours, extensive reliance on AI tools is discouraged. The purpose of office hours is to assess and improve your understanding. Overuse of AI during this time may result in a warning or affect your participation grade. The purpose of office hours is not to identify LLM hallucinations by comparing answers with the TA on duty, nor to explain why the LLM may or may not have hallucinated on a given prompt.</p> <p>This policy may be subject to change as we continue to evaluate the impact of AI tools on learning outcomes. Students will be notified of any changes to this policy via Campuswire announcement (and an updated policy here). We are trying to strike a balance between use of modern tools and comprehensive understanding of course fundamentals. Use AI responsibly and as a learning aid, not a substitute for your own critical thinking and problem-solving skills; future you will thank you.</p>"},{"location":"archive/fall-2025/policies/#university-and-college-policies","title":"University and College Policies","text":"<ul> <li> <p>We in the Illinois ECE community are committed to understanding, empathizing with, and respecting each other, embracing the many differences among us.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Grainger College of Engineering is committed to the creation of an anti-racist, inclusive community that welcomes diversity along a number of dimensions, including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, disability status, class, age, or religious beliefs.

These concepts can be organized around three core tasks: (a) sensing, perception, and state estimation; (b) decision making, planning, and control; and (c) evaluation and correctness arguments based on formal verification. Machine learning techniques play an important role across all three tasks. You will also gain hands-on experience implementing algorithms and models using state-of-the-art software tools. Finally, the course provides practical experience in engineering a complete autonomy stack for a sensor-rich platform\u2014such as a full-sized vehicle, a quadrotor, or a scaled vehicle\u2014with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation.</p> <p>Expectations: You are expected to (a) attend lectures (TTh 11\u201312:30) and keep up with the material through the suggested exercises; (b) complete four homework and programming assignments; (c) attend Friday lab sections to discuss and work through assignments; (d) prepare for and take three in-class midterms; and (e) complete a substantial autonomy project.
